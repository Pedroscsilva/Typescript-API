## Typescript API

This was my first typescript API, made with MySQL2, JWT and Express.

I really enjoyed constructing it, as it was my first project developed with typescript.

If you want to check it, you can clone this repository. 

Provided you have Docker and docker-compose installed on your machine, you may follow the commands below in your terminal to see the API working:

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
$ docker exec -it trybesmith bash
```

It should open the bash version of the newly created container. After that, you can install the project's node_modules and start the API.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

If you would like any help executing it or if you have any suggestion on how to improve this code, please reach me out!
